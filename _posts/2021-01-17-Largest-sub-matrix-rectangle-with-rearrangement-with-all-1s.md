We at Tech Munching provide you the cleanest, easy to understand solutions to difficult competitive coding questions. This question #1727 appeared in LeetCode contest #224.

***

*Here is the question:*

You are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and you are allowed to rearrange the **columns** of the `matrix` in any order.

Return *the area of the largest submatrix within* `matrix` *where **every** element of the submatrix is* `1` *after reordering the columns optimally.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.

```

*Here is our proposed solution:*

> Not to console the audience reading it after the contest, however, this wasn't necessarily a `medium` problem. *As with life, this problem also has multiple solutions to it*. So, please comment down in case you would need further solutions based on DP or so.

Let's try to look at the problem in a different way, can we think of `value 1` as adding a floor to the building and `value 0` as ground level of the building. Our task is to find the max rectangle with parallel buildings and because the columns can be rearranged, we can move the buildings.

Here are the height of the building for each row:

|       | Col 1  | Col 2  | Col 3  |
| ----- |:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Row 1 |      0 |      0 |      1 |
| Row 2 |      1 |      1 |      2 | (Previous floor adds up in coloumn 3)
| Row 3 |      2 |      0 |      3 | (Ground floor in coloumn 2 nullifies previous height)

Since, we can actually move the coloumns, above rows after sorting can be represented as:

|       | Col 1  | Col 2  | Col 3  |
| ----- |:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Row 1 |      1 |      0 |      0 |
| Row 2 |      2 |      1 |      1 | 
| Row 3 |      3 |      2 |      0 |

Once you reach this state, finding the max rectangles for each building is height * width. 

For example:

Row 3 & Col 1 : 3 (height) * 1 (width)

Row 3 & Col 1 & Col 2 : 2 (height) * 2 (width)

Here is complete solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestSubmatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.empty()) return 0;
        
        vector<int> brickLevel (matrix[0].size(), 0);
        
        int answer = numeric_limits<int>::min();
        
        for (auto i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            for (auto j = 0; j < matrix[0].size(); j++) // set the brick value
                brickLevel[j] = matrix[i][j] == 0 ? 0 : brickLevel[j] + 1;
            
            // sort bricks to keep buildings consecutive
            auto mx = brickLevel;
            sort(mx.begin(), mx.end(), greater());
            
            for (auto i = 0; i < mx.size(); i++)
                answer = max(answer, (i + 1) * mx[i]);
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

The time complexity for a matrix of `MxN` will be `MNlog(N)`. That's easy to understand, the outer loop iterates M rows which iterates N columns and sort vector of length N which is `M * (N + Nlog(N))`, which asymptotically is `MNlog(N)`.
